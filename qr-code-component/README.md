## My process

I simulated the component size in figma to better understand the spacing, font size and started to develop. I needed to change the color hsl(212, 45%, 89%) (light gray) to hsl(219, 14%, 32%) because the contrast was very low.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
